*Making fast things, making slow things fast and making fast things faster*.

I am **ZXPrism**, a person who is insterested in a wide variety of things.

Currently, I'm focusing on:

- computer graphics
- embedded development
- control systems
- power electronics

Sometimes I will try crafting some intriguing gizmos, like balance cars, railguns, etc. To be honest, none of them worked fine as expected, but I just love them.

In my spare time, I often solve CP(competitive programming) problems from the platforms like Codeforces, Atcoder, Leetcode, etc. Not having paticipated in any offline contests before though, I wish I could have such opportunities in the future.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
